# Integrating LSTM-Based Sales Forecasting and RFM Customer Segmentation to Enhance E-Commerce Business Strategies 

**Dataset*** : The dataset is taken from a public dataset with the title eCommerce Events History in Cosmetics Shop (https://www.kaggle.com/code/mariaig94/e-commerce-events-in-cosmetic-store). The dataset includes historical data on user interactions in online cosmetics stores from October 2019 to February 2020. The historical data is stored in five csv files separated by the month of the event.

**Background**: In today's digital age, customer behavior in e-commerce is a major focus for companies to improve customer experience and profitability. This is significant because the primary goal of raising the company's profit is to maximize the percentage of revenue. However, in real cases, very few customers make purchases compared to the overall events that occur in e-commerce.

**Objective**: To maximize purchase percentage and optimize business strategy through forecasting and customer segmentation.

**Methods**: Uses a quantitative approach with a sales forecasting method using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and customer segmentation analysis using the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) approach. Data is gathered from customer events in e-commerce and evaluated to develop effective company strategies.

**Results**: The LSTM model showed strong performance in forecasting purchase events with a test Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) value of 8.4%, confirming the reliability of the model in capturing temporal patterns and trends. Customer segmentation successfully identified four main groups: Loyal Customers, Potentially Loyal Customers, New Customers, and At-Risk Customers. Each group has unique characteristics and requires different handling strategies to increase loyalty and reduce churn.

**Conclusion**: The results show that the integration between sales forecasting and customer segmentation can provide deep and strategic insights to design more effective marketing strategies. Although the proposed strategies are reasonable, further testing and evaluation are needed to adjust to other variables such as culture and geography. This research makes an important contribution in understanding customer behavior and suggests that follow-up studies should focus on tuning the hyperparameters of the model and adding more features to improve predictive power.
